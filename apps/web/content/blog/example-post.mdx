# Building Scalable React Applications

As React applications grow in size and complexity, maintaining a clean and scalable codebase becomes increasingly important. In this post, I'll share some strategies I've found useful for building maintainable React applications.

## Component Organization

One of the first challenges in scaling a React app is deciding how to organize your components. Here's a structure that works well:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── features/     # Feature-specific components
│   └── layouts/      # Layout components
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
├── lib/              # Utility functions
└── app/              # Next.js app router
```

## Custom Hooks for Reusability

Custom hooks are a powerful way to extract and reuse logic across components. Here's a `useLocalStorage` hook with full TypeScript support:

```typescript
import { useState } from "react";

function useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value: T | ((val: T) => T)) => {
    try {
      const valueToStore =
        value instanceof Function ? value(storedValue) : value;
      setStoredValue(valueToStore);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue] as const;
}

// Usage example
const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage<string>("name", "Antoni");
```

## Performance Optimization

Consider these optimization techniques:

- Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
- Leverage `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` appropriately
- Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
- Optimize images and assets

## Conclusion

Building scalable React applications requires thoughtful planning and consistent patterns. Start with these fundamentals and adjust based on your specific needs.
